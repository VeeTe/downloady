# downloady
Command-line file download helper, generating scripts for copy/pasting :)

## Demo:

Ex.: I have 3 files I need to do remote administration on a several servers; but SSH, SMB, nor drag/drop RDP is unavailable. I know that httpclient file transfer via powershell works, but I am too lazy to copy-paste stuff over and over again - so I want to do it in 1 go, now I can.


### Usage:

1. Put the downloady.py in the same folder as the files you're downloading to the remote folder
2. Find your private IP (for this example it will be 10.1.1.1)
3. Run the downloady.py
4. Start the http.server in the same directory as other files (python3 -m http.server 4040)
5. Paste the command generated by downloady into the remote host & check to see if you got the file downloaded

	Example downloady commands:
	- python3 downloady.py webrequest http://10.1.1.1/file.txt psdocuments
	- python3 downloady.py all http://10.1.1.1:4040/ all -f files.txt
	- python3 downloady.py lolw http://10.1.1.1/ ps -f files.txt


### Downloady output:
```
python3 downloady.py httpclient http://10.1.1.1/ psdocuments -f files.txt
